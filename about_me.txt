After leading a team at Ever-Lab, a premier wellness and biohacking center, I honed my skills in managing complex projects and driving innovation. My role involved not only leadership but also deep engagement with cutting-edge wellness practices. This experience ignited my passion for solving intricate problems and inspired me to seek new challenges where I could further leverage my strengths.

Motivated by a commitment to lifelong learning and a desire to integrate diverse fields, I ventured into software development. I was drawn to the dynamic nature of tech and its potential to transform industries, including wellness. My transition was fueled by a strategic vision to blend my background in reflexology and herbal treatments with modern technology to create holistic health solutions.

To achieve this, I embarked on a structured path that included a rigorous three-week online coding course, followed by four months of intensive programming study. Each step was carefully planned as part of a broader strategy to not only master software development but also to understand how it can be applied innovatively in the wellness industry. 

Now, as I craft my 12-week syllabus and prepare to enter the tech field as a junior full-stack developer, I am focused on not just changing careers but on creating a niche that bridges my past expertise with my future in tech. My goal is to innovate at the intersection of wellness and technology, driving advancements that benefit both sectors.
